# Some common steps in a CI setup include linting, testing, and building. What are the specific tools for taking care of these steps in the ecosystem of the language you picked?

For language like Java, there are several tools to use for linting, testing and building.

## A linter for Java

unfortunately, In java there is no one peace of tool to use to achieve the whole tasks of linting (unlike the case in eslint for JavaScript). So, we can merge a set of tools to achieve all tasks of linting. We can use spotbugs (a tool for finding bugs in Java programs), PMD (a tool that analyizes the java source code to find flaws like unused variables) and checkstyle (a tool that helps java developers to write code that adhere to a coding standard)

## A testing framework for Java

For unit and integretion testing, we can use JUnit (a unit testing library for Jave). And, for end to end testing, we can use Arquillian with Selenium and additional extensions, like: Arquillian Cube (docker container manager), Arquillian Drone (provides a simple way to include functional tests for an application with a web-based user interface), Arquillian Graphene 2(Robust Functional Tests leveraging WebDriver with flavour of neat AJAX-ready API), JMeter(A pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance), and Cukes in Space(allows you to deploy and run Cucumber features in the application server of your choice using the Arquillian test framework).

### A builder for Java

There are a lots of building tools for java, we can use any of the following: Maven, Gradle or Ant.

# What alternatives are there to set up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions?

As an alternatives for host-based CI/CD Jenkins and could-base CI/CD Github Actions, we can use any of the following:

- TravisCI
- Buddy
- Bamboo
- CircleCI
- GitLab
- Integrity
- GoCd

# Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

The cloud-based environment is the appropriate choice If:

- the project is in a small or medium scale software (In other words: not large-scaled).
- the team is not big (Not more than 6 developers).

since the team of the project consists of six developers, I think cloud-based environment is a good choice for CI/CD.
